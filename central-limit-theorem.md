# The Central Limit Theorem

One of the fundamental concepts in statistics, and all of mathematics. It states:
1. Let's start with any (discreet or continuous) distribution that has a well defined mean. (don't know what the definition of a well-defined mean is)
2. We take a sample of some size n (n samples from the distribution)
3. We calculate the mean of this sample set (across the n samples)
4. We plot it on a graph, where x is the value of the mean, and y is how many times we got this mean -> a histogram!
5. Repeat steps 2-4 many times, building up the histogram.

The Central Limit Theorem says, that the distribution of this histogram is in the limit is the normal (gaussian) distribution. In other words, the probability distribution of the sample means of any distribution is the normal distribution.

There's a long answer on Stack Overflow about the intuition behind CLT that is worth going through. https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/3734/what-intuitive-explanation-is-there-for-the-central-limit-theorem
